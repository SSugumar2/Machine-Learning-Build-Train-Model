## **Project Background: The Crucial Role of Weather in WWII Military Strategy**

Weather conditions during World War II were unpredictable, and they had a direct impact on the outcome of key military operations, particularly **aerial bombing missions**. Factors like **rain, snow, fog, and extreme temperatures** could hinder visibility, affect aircraft performance, and influence mission success. By analyzing historical weather data, we aim to uncover hidden patterns that could provide a clearer understanding of how weather conditions influenced military decisions and mission outcomes during the war.

## **Dataset Overview: A Wealth of Historical Data**

### **Context and Source: Sourcing the WWII Weather Data**

This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset available on Kaggle, known as the **World War II Weather Dataset**. It contains weather data collected from various stations worldwide, offering daily records of weather conditions during the war. This dataset includes vital features such as **precipitation, wind speeds, and temperature**, which are instrumental in understanding how these factors influenced military operations.

### **Key Features of the Dataset: Variables that Matter**

- **Weather Station (STA):** Identifier for each weather station.
- **Date:** The specific date of the weather observation.
- **Precipitation (Precip):** Daily precipitation in millimeters.
- **Wind Gust Speed (WindGustSpd):** Peak wind gust speed in kilometers per hour.
- **Maximum and Minimum Temperature (MaxTemp, MinTemp):** Daily high and low temperatures.
- **Mean Temperature (MeanTemp):** Daily average temperature.
- **Snowfall:** Amount of snow and ice pellets in millimeters.
- **Poor Weather Indicator (PoorWeather):** Flags indicating extreme weather conditions like thunderstorms or fog.
- **Year (YR):** Year of the observation.

### **Dataset Insights: Rich Historical Context**

The dataset contains over **119,000 entries** with **39 features**, providing a robust foundation for analysis. This large volume of data offers opportunities to uncover meaningful patterns, correlations, and trends that can inform our understanding of how weather impacted military operations during World War II.

## **Methodology: Using Machine Learning to Analyze Weather Data**

Our approach involves applying **machine learning** techniques to predict **mean temperatures** based on historical weather data. The process includes the following key steps:

### **1. Data Preprocessing: Preparing the Data for Analysis**

- **Outlier Removal:** Using the **Winsorization** technique to mitigate the effect of extreme values that could distort the model.
- **Mean Imputation:** Addressing missing values by replacing them with the mean of the respective column.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalizing numeric features using **MinMaxScaler** to ensure that all features are on a similar scale.

### **2. Modeling: Applying Machine Learning Algorithms**

We used two different approaches for temperature prediction:

- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:** A linear regression model that assumes a direct relationship between the input features and the target variable (mean temperature).
- **Decision Tree Regression:** A non-linear model that can capture more complex relationships between the features and the target variable.

### **3. Evaluation: Assessing Model Performance**

We assessed the models' predictive accuracy using key metrics:

- **Mean Error (ME)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

These metrics allowed us to determine how well the models predicted mean temperatures based on historical weather data.

## **Results: Performance Evaluation of the Models**

### **Model Performance: Comparing OLS and Decision Tree Regressors**

#### **OLS Regression**
- **Training RMSE:** 2.21
- **Testing RMSE:** 2.26

OLS Regression performed well but exhibited **slightly higher residuals**, indicating it might not capture all the complexities in the data.

#### **Decision Tree Regression**
- **Training RMSE:** 2.45
- **Testing RMSE:** 2.50

While **Decision Tree Regression** performed similarly, its ability to handle non-linear relationships made it a strong candidate for capturing the intricate patterns in the data.

### **Statistical Insights: Understanding the Data Distribution**

- **Skewness and Kurtosis:** The **precipitation** and **snowfall** data were found to have **high skewness** and **kurtosis**, indicating the presence of extreme values that likely correspond to rare but impactful weather events during the war.
